#A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

#Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
print(x)

#String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
x = "John"
#is the same as
x = 'John'

#Variable names are case-sensitive.
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will not overwrite a
