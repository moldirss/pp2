#The escape character allows you to use double quotes when you normally would not be allowed:
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
print(txt)

#You will get an error if you use double quotes inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
"""txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."""
